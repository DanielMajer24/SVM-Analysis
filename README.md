# SVM-Analysis

This report was one of the most challenging university assessments I have ever completed. It consisted of two tasks which assessed students ability to implement respective Machine Learning models using R which were taught throughout the course. The main focus of the assessment was Support Vector Machines in which is assessed students theoretical and practical knowledge.

The first task required students to manually implement the SVM to create an optimised hyperplane which could be used to classifying new data points in they were introduced. The second task was a practical exercise in which a selected Machine Learning model would be compared to SVM. The selected machine learning model for this exercise was XGBoost.
